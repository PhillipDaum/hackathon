- The present state of this document is between a readme and a brainstorm

## The issue
**Reduce Gloabal food insecurity** 
- Empowering people who grow food plants or want to grow food plants
- it is a lot of complex information to process to do this well
- Getting started is difficult for a lot of people
- There is a lack of easily accesible information
- Also, some people don't know what they need to know
- on top of that the process of figuring out where, when and how to plant things within your garden can be daunting 
- it is healthier than a lot of available foods
- its sustainable
- it reduces the impact on food infrastucure (ie victory gardens)
- it could even be done in food deserts!
- it also draws attention to these healthy and sustainable practices
